## Image Requirements Checklist

✅ **Dimensions**: Minimum 1200x900px (4:3 ratio)

## Optimization Tools

Before adding images to your project, optimize them:

1. **TinyPNG**: https://tinypng.com/
   - Drag and drop images
   - Download compressed versions
   - Usually 50-70% size reduction

2. **Squoosh**: https://squoosh.app/
   - More control over compression
   - Compare before/after
   - WebP conversion option

3. **ImageOptim** (Mac): https://imageoptim.com/
   - Batch processing
   - Lossless compression

## Quick Batch Download Script

I've created a Node.js script that can help download images programmatically.
See `downloadImages.js` for automated downloading.

## Folder Structure

Ensure you save images to the correct folders:

```
public/images/
├── pizzas/
│   ├── margherita.jpg
│   ├── regina.jpg
│   ├── 4-fromages.jpg
│   └── ... (9 more)
├── boissons/
│   ├── coca-cola.jpg
│   ├── sprite.jpg
│   └── ... (8 more)
├── desserts/
│   ├── tiramisu.jpg
│   └── ... (5 more)
└── accompagnements/
    ├── focaccia-ail.jpg
    └── ... (7 more)
```

## Verification

After adding all images, run:
```bash
node scripts/verifyImages.js
```

This will check that all 46 required images are present.

## Tips for Finding Great Images

1. **Look for:**
   - Close-up shots showing texture
   - Natural lighting (not too yellow/blue)
   - Clean backgrounds
   - Fresh, appetizing appearance

2. **Avoid:**
   - Watermarked images
   - Low resolution (<800px)
   - Overly edited/filtered photos
   - Stock photos with fake-looking food

3. **Free Image Sources:**
   - Unsplash (https://unsplash.com) - Best quality
   - Pexels (https://pexels.com) - Good variety
   - Pixabay (https://pixabay.com) - Large library
   - Foodiesfeed (https://foodiesfeed.com) - Food-specific

## Licensing

- ✅ Free for commercial use
- ✅ No attribution required
- ✅ Can be modified

## Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Use the placeholder generator (scripts/generatePlaceholders.html)
2. Start with just pizza images (the most important)
3. Add other categories later
4. Use the admin upload tool to add images one by one

## Estimated Time

- Manual download: 30-45 minutes for all 46 images
- With AI generation: 1-2 hours
- Using placeholder generator: 5 minutes (but lower quality)
